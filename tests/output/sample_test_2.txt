St. Thomas EV Battery Plant
Volkswagen has committed to developing a new $7 billion dollar electric vehicle battery plant in St. Thomas, the largest EV related investment in Canadian history.  The plant will create 3,000 direct jobs and up to 30,000 indirect jobs.  Expected completion in 2027.  Plant is expected to produce batteries for up to one million vehicles per year.  Construction expected to begin next year.  
The government of Ontario has committed to provide $500 million in direct incentives to Volkswagen, as well as hundreds of millions of additional funds to strengthen and grow St. Thomas.  Included in the infrastructure improvements is the expansion of Highway 3 from two to four lanes; a four lane bypass will be built to connect to Highway 4, allowing for direct access to Highway 401.
